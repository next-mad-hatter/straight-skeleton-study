* Found one (simple) instance which crashes the program --
  is this due to a bug or violated instance constraint
  (e.g. general position or some such)?

* Get rid of dependencies remaining local (randomPolygon & poly2tri)
* Library interface
* Count events (flip, split etc, extraordinary = flip not changing angle category?)

* Polygon generating program writes those as xml files,
  skeleton part reads/writes plain text
* Generate large instances & measure performance on those
* Include a random generation alternative?
* Zoom & autozoom at load

* History: back steps
* Straight jump to result

* Large weights -> animation sometimes gets too slow at some point
* Animation speed, animations switchable

* Enable comparison of skeletons when changing weights / moving vertex

* Investigate numerical stability
* Non-self-intersection test  (e.g. https://www.webcitation.org/6ahkPQIsN)?
* Alternative (fx/fn-fx/re-frame etc) ui if changes extensive?
