The source code found herein uses two libraries not present in common java
repositories:

  * poly2tri : available at http://sites-final.uclouvain.be/mema/Poly2Tri/

    It appears this is an ancient port of http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/
    (which today redirects to a github repo containing C++ code), contemporary
    versions of which seem to have significantly different API.

  * randomPoly : written by R. Purgstaller, it is currently only available to
    us in binary form and terms of redistribution are not quite clear.  It
    either will be made available under appropriate license when this repo goes
    public or the functionality in question purged.

Added both to bitbucket downloads section for now.
