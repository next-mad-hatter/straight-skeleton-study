The source code found herein uses two libraries not present in common java
repositories:

  * poly2tri : available at http://sites-final.uclouvain.be/mema/Poly2Tri/

    It appears this is an ancient port of http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/
    (which today redirects to a github repo containing C++ code), contemporary
    versions of which seem to have significantly different API.

  * randomPoly : ?

    It is not clear to me yet where this comes from, nor distribution
    conditions of the jar file found in the archives.

Added both to bitbucket downloads section for now.
